# Current Experiment:
# 
# We are experimenting with using the robots.txt Noindex: directive instead of a meta tag to remove pages from the index
# 
# There are conflicting opinions on their validity and a lack of case studies (nothing new in Organic Search)
#
# We are curious to see whether Google crawls these pages at a similar rate as pages with a noindex meta tag (or even at all)
#
# We will check the SERPs and our server logs will publish the results shortly
