<h1>Incorrectly configured DNS</h1>
<p>If you can see this message, then your DNS is incorrectly configured. All DNS traffic should be configured to go via your secure web gateway to provide the best user experience.</p>
<p>This is typically done by using the secure web gateway as a DNS forwarder on your current internal DNS server (or using the secure web gateway directly as your DNS server).</p>
