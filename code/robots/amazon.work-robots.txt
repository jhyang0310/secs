        <p class="section-header">Entering my Login</p>
        <p class="question">What is my Amazon Login?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Your Login can be found at the top of your Amazon badge above your photo. It's also the same as your username/alias that you log into Amazon's devices or computers.
        </p>

        <p class="section-header">Selecting a mobile phone number</p>
        <p class="question">Why do I need to select a mobile phone number?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          We need to verify your identity by sending a code by text to your mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why don't I see my mobile phone number?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          We will only show phone numbers that you have registered with Amazon. To add a mobile number, access the Hub on the Amazon network and add it to your contact details on the Profile page.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Will I be charged to receive text/SMS from Amazon?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          This depends on your mobile carrier and plan. Please check with your mobile provider for more details on text message/SMS charges.
        </p>
        <p class="question">How do I log into the Hub if I don't have my mobile phone with me?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          First time access to the Hub from outside the Amazon network requires that you have a mobile phone available so you can receive a verification code. Once you've registered your device, if you're not using a public or shared device, you can choose to have the Hub remember your device for 30 days. After that period, you'll need your mobile phone to register your device again.

          <p class="section-header">Entering Amazon's verification code</p>
          <p class="question">I didn't receive a verification code, what should I do?</p>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Please confirm that you selected your mobile phone number and that your cellular plan supports text messages. If you have a prepaid text plan, you may have run out of SMS credits. Please call your carrier to resolve this problem. If you have a USA or Canadian phone number, and unable to receive text messages, you may have blocked text messages from Amazon. Please text 'RESUME' to 262966 to restart Amazon text messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, it's possible that your mobile carrier has blocked Amazon's text messages. Please call your carrier to unblock text messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any point, you can try again by clicking on the "Back" button to request a new code.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="question">I selected the wrong phone number to receive the code. How can I select a different mobile phone number?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            You can request a new code to a different mobile phone by clicking on the "Back" button on the page.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Can I use the same code twice?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            You have to request for a new code every time you log in with a new device.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Why do I need to enter a verification code each time I log in from the same device?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            Click the "Remember this device" checkbox to skip code verification for 30 days. Don't select this option if you are using a public computer or a device that isn't yours.
          </p>
          <p class="question">I've received verification codes from Amazon Hub when I have not requested one. How do I stop Amazon from sending me text messages?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            If you have a USA or Canadian phone number, reply 'STOP' to the message you received to stop any future text messages from Amazon. Also, you can reply 'RESUME' to restart Amazon text messages. For other numbers, please contact ERC. View the ERC Contact Information section in the FAQ for your region's contact information.
