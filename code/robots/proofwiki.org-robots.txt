# Friendly, low-speed bots are welcome viewing article pages, but not

# There is a special exception for API mobileview to allow dynamic
# mobile web & app views to load section content.
# These views aren't HTTP-cached but use parser cache aggressively
# and don't expose special: pages etc.
#
# Another exception is for REST API documentation, located at
# /api/rest_v1/?doc.
